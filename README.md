# vGDB
vGDB iOS Alpha Release

Contributions:

Marcus Cruz: XX%
• Settings screen

James Trevino: XX%
• Majority of the Login screen
• Settings screen

Jason Ngo: XX%
• Learned the Parse API and set up the backend database

Differences:
- You said our alpha was light on features, so we included the settings menu in the alpha release.
- The settings menu was not actually in our original app idea paper.
- We decided to use Parse as our backend. This was not specified in our paper.
- We made minor visual changes to the app, which included changing the appearance of buttons and the login UI.
